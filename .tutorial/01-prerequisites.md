## Prerequisites
Before you get started and run this code, you will need a few things, set as
environment variables (secrets).
- Greenlight invite code
- Breez API key
- A mnemonic phrase

### Greenlight (GREENLIGHT_INVITE_CODE)
For creating a node on Greenlight, you will need a Greenlight invite code. 
Contact Breez or Blockstream to obtain an invite code. Or get one from the 
person that referred you to this replit.

### LSP (BREEZ_API_KEY)
In order to use the liquidity from the Breez lightning service provider, you
need an API key. Contact Breez to obtain an API key. Or get one from the 
person that referred you to this replit.

### Mnemonic (MNEMONIC)
To make sure you don't lose your funds after running this replit, you'll need
to provide a mnemonic. When you run the replit for the first time, and no 
mnemonic is set, the program will generate a mnemonic for you and exit 
immediately. Save the mnemonic somewhere and set the environment variable.
